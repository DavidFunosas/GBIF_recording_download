# GBIF recording download
Code to download all recordings uploaded on Xeno-canto, iNaturalist, observation.org, ZFMK and MinIO and to extract the corresponding metadata based on GBIF results (GBIF.org, 2025). To avoid duplicate downloads, the code ensures that recordings are not redownloaded if an entry from the same species, date, and author has already been retrieved from another platform. 


Instructions:
1. Download the updated list of animal recordings available on online platforms based on the GBIF Occurrence Search tool, and replace the "GBIF_ort_hem_recordings_in_Europe_2025-02-05" folder under "Data/Input/" with the export results. The original folder contains all European orthopteran and cicada recordings having been uploaded before February 5, 2025.
2. Replace the file "Orthopteran_and_cicada_species_in_North_Central_and_temperate_Western_Europe.csv" in the "Data/Input/" folder with the list of species whose recordings you want to download. The original file contains a list of all sound-producing orthopteran and cicada species and subspecies present in North, Central and temperate Western Europe (Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, metropolitan France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland).
3. Run the "Downloading and file renaming.R" script in the "R scripts/" folder.
